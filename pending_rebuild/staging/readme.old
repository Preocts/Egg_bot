## Customizable Discord Chat Bot

The idea behind Egg_Bot's core code is to have a very slim script that is powered by Discord.py but can be enhanced with modules. The script will attempt to auto-load any .py file found in the ./modules path and integrate configured events for that module.

Each module, in a sense, is its own bot responding to the event feed from the core script.

What started as a simple way to send a welcome message when a new user joined a guild, Egg Bot has expanded to include:

- Core Discord bot that listens to events flows from On Messages, On Join, and On Typing
- Auto module loading for plugin of features around these events including and not limited too:
  - Definable greetings, both DM and chat, for new user joins
  - A custom, regex driven, alert system that watches for mentions of your choice called ShoulderBird
  - Highly definable permission based chat commands
    - Control by Guild, Channels, Roles, and Users
  - Bot Guard - an allow list for bots that kicks unexpected bots to reduce noise/spam/scams
  - Chat Kudos - Karma from IRC and HipChat is born again
  - more features in the works
