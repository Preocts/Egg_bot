# Chat Kudos Module v1.0.0

### Kudo points brought to Discord

Chat Kudos are points that can be granted, or taken, from server members by simply mentioning their name and having "+"s or "-"s following the mention.  The bot will reply with a customizable message, tell you how many kudos were just received, and keep a running tally.

There is a leaderboard built in that, by default, displays the top ten Kudos holders in the guild. Fun for the competitive natured souls.

Control who can use Kudos with the allow lists. Out-of-the-box Kudos only allows roles and users on these lists to use the module. The server owner is always on the allow list. This lets you quickly grant access to your choice of members if you want to keep the reigns tight.

Don't care who uses Kudos? Want to see just how quickly your chat devolves into a free-for-all point battle? Simply unlock the module and everyone can add/remove Kudos, show the leaderboard, and request help docs be sent to their DM.

Chat line configuration controls are always restricted to allowed users only.

## Granting and Removing Kudos:

```
Me> @Some_Member +++
Egg_Bot> 3 points to Some_Member

Me> @Some_Member ---
Egg_Bot> 3 points from Some_Member

me> @Some_Member +Awesome-Sauce+
Egg_Bot> 1 points to Some_Member
```

The mention can be located anywhere in the chat mention. The "+" and "-" need to follow the mention immediately and not have spaces separating them.

#### Basic Commands:

*Open to anyone allowed to run Kudos*

**kudo!board** (#)

- Show top scoreboard in the channel the command is run. Scoreboard defaults to the top 10 Kudos holders but you can provide a number to specify how many results you want to display.

**kudo!help**

- A short version of this document will be DM'ed in Discord

---

#### Config Commands:

*Can only be run by members on the user allow list*

*Server owner always has access to this*

**kudo!set max** [#]

- When this value is greater than zero the number of Kudos applied or removed from a member will be limited to the max value.
- Set this to 0 or -1 to remove restriction

**kudo!set gain** [message to display on gain]

**kudo!set loss** [message to display on loss]

- Define a custom message for when a member gains or loses Kudos.
  - "{points}" will be replaced with # of points
  - "{name}" will be replaced with user's display name


**kudo!set user** [@mention] (@mention)...

**kudo!set role** [@role_name] (@role_name)...

- Controls what is on the allow lists for users and roles. This acts as a toggle. Adding a user who is already on the list will remove them. Same for roles
- You can add as many users or roles as desired in one call (2000 character limit)
- You can even mix and match roles and users, these are aliased for clarity but run the same functions.

**kudo!set lock**

- Turns lock on or off.
- When Kudos is locked only allowed users/roles can use Kudos. Server owner always has access to Kudos regardless of lock.
- This is the same as adding @everyone to role allow list without pinging the entire server.

## Adding Kudos to your Discord.py bot

While created for my own egg_bot system, this module is designed to be added to any Discord bot code that is running off the discord.py library. The class needs to be initialized and then you simply pass the discord.message to the .onMessage() method.

Installation (assumes you have installed python3+ and discord.py):

[Download chatKudos.py into your working directory](https://github.com/Preocts/Egg_Bot/blob/source/modules/chatKudos.py)

Sample Code:
```python
import discord
import chatKudos

client = discord.Client()
kudos = chatKudos.chatKudos('./wherever/youwant.json')


@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    await kudos.onMessage(message=message)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    discord_token = 'Your Secret Here'
    client.run(discord_token)
```

The first time you run this you will seen an error in the logs for a bad/missing configuration. The script is designed to fail gracefully and create everything it needs to run for the guild owner. The first time you run a Kudo command, grant a Kudo, or destroy the instance of the class a config file will be saved to the path provided.

The default config path is ./config/chatKudos.json from your working directory.
